ELC 5312 - SoC 
Project by Loc Nguyen
Instruction:
-	Use the ADXL362 accelerometer supplied on the Nexys A7 board to track its motion, which can output
values with the use of UART and eight 7-segments display. I am also integrating the GPO LED core as an indicator for (X,Y) orientation of the accelerometer.
