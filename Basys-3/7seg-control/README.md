The purpose of this lab is to generate a 1Hz clock and control the 7 segments on the Basys 3 board. 

The lab will includes 4 verilog files and 1 constraint file.
  1. digits.v
  2. oneHz_gen.v
  3. seg_cntrl.v
  4. top.v
  5. constr_basys3.xdc

This lab was done by using Vivado design suite to synthesize and analyze the HDL design. It was also used to program the Basys 3 board.
