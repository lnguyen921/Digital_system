Using 50MHZ clock to divide it into a frequency outputting at 1KHz signal.
Clock divider:
    - Known as frequency divider.
    - Using count, you can divide the input clock into a slower clock signal for the output.

    Count Value  Output Frequency
    1            25Mhz
    25           1MHz
    50           500KHz
    1000         25KHz
    25000000     1Hz
